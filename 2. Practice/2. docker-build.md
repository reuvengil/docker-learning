# Practice Building Docker Images with an Express Node.js Project
<img src="./images/docker-build.png" width="500px" height="220px"  style="border-radius:5px;"></img>

In this practice, you will learn how to build a Docker image for an Express Node.js project. You will use a set of files in a folder named [Express-Build](../Express-Build/) to build the image, and you will configure the Dockerfile to copy these files into the image, create a volume for the public folder, and run the container on a specific port.


**`Please note`**, all commands are provided at your service in the [dockerfile commands.md](../3.%20Commands/2.%20Dockerfile%20commands.md) and [build commands.md](../3.%20Commands/3.%20build%20commands.md).

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Navigate to the [Express-Build](../Express-Build/) directory.
2. Create a Dockerfile in the directory.
3. Specify the node **`base image`** for the Dockerfile, use version **`node:14-alpine`**.
4. Set the **`working directory`** to **/app**.
5. **`Copy`** the package.json file to the current directory ( `.` ). 
6. Install dependencies: In the Dockerfile, use the [RUN](../3.%20Commands/2.%20Dockerfile%20commands.md#Run) command to install node dependencies (`npm install`).
7. **`Copy`** the contents of the current host directory( `.` ) into the container at **`/app`**, **notice** that after setting working directory the current directory of the container is already **`/app`**.
8. Create **`ENTRYPOINT`** with the command `npm start` to determine what will run when the container started.

9. In the terminal, **build** the docker image using a tag name of your choice. see how to do it in the file [build commands.md](../3.%20Commands/3.%20build%20commands.md).

10. After building the image, it's time to [run](../3.%20Commands/1.%20basic%20commands.md#Run) it. Depending on your operating system, you need to use specific configurations.

    If you're working on **`Linux`**, you can set the container's **network mode** to **'host'** and **configure the PORT `environment variable`** to the desired port when running the container.

    On the other hand, if you're working on **`WSL`** (Windows Subsystem for Linux), set the container's **network mode** to **'bridge'** and enable **port mapping**. You can achieve this by mapping a port, such as 3000 in the container, to your environment's specified PORT. To do this, use the mapping format '3000:{your env PORT}'. Additionally, utilize the -v flag to create a volume for the '/app/public' directory.
    
    When working on Windows, please pay attention to the folder path for the public directory. Unlike in Linux, the correct path format for Windows is '.\public' instead of './public'. Make sure to use the backslash `'\'` instead of the forward slash `'/'` when specifying the folder path.

11. Once the container is running, you can test if everything works as expected by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:{PORT}/`. Be sure to replace `{PORT}` with the port number specified in the `docker run` command or set in the `PORT` environment variable.

11. To verify that the volume was correctly mounted, **copy** the file [monkey.html](../Express-Build/monkey.html) to the `public` folder **while the container is still running**. Then, visit `http://localhost:{PORT}/monkey.html` in your web browser. If you can see the image, it means that the volume is working correctly.
