## Build commands

The `docker build` command is used to build a Docker image from a Dockerfile. Here are the basic steps to use the docker build command:

```docker
docker build [OPTIONS] PATH
```
Commonly used options include:
- `-t`, To tag the image with a name and optional tag
- `-f`, To specify a Dockerfile other than the default `Dockerfile`.

`PATH` is the path to the directory that contains the Dockerfile and any files that need to be copied into the image.

For example:
```docker
docker build -t my_image:1.0 .
```
This command tells Docker to build an image and tag it with the name `my_image` and the tag `1.0`, using the Dockerfile located in the current directory (`.`).
