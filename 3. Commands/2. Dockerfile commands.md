A Dockerfile is a script that contains a set of instructions used to build a Docker image. These instructions are written using various Dockerfile commands. In this guide, we will go through some of the most common Dockerfile commands and provide examples of their usage.
#
## ARG
The `ARG` command sets a **`build-time`** variable that can be used in other Dockerfile commands. This allows you to pass in variables during the build process.

Example:
```docker
ARG APP_VERSION=1.0
RUN echo "Building version $APP_VERSION"
```
#
## FROM

The `FROM` command specifies the base image to use for building your Docker image. It should always be the first command in your Dockerfile.

Example:
```docker
FROM ubuntu:20.04
```
#
## RUN

The `RUN` command executes a command within the Docker container during the build process. You can use this command to install software, update packages, or configure the system.

Example:

```docker
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3
```
#
## COPY

The `COPY` command copies files from the host machine to the Docker container.

Example:

```docker
COPY app.py /app/
```
#
## WORKDIR

The `WORKDIR` command sets the working directory for subsequent commands in the Dockerfile.

Example:
```docker
WORKDIR /app
```
#
## CMD
The `CMD` command specifies the command to run when the container starts. You can only have one CMD command in your Dockerfile.

Example:
```docker
CMD [ "python3", "app.py" ]
```

#
## ENTRYPOINT
The `ENTRYPOINT` command specifies the command to run when the container starts. You can also pass arguments to the ENTRYPOINT command.

Example:
```docker
ENTRYPOINT [ "python3", "app.py" ]
```
#
## ENV
The `ENV` command sets environment variables in the Docker container.

Example:
```docker
ENV APP_NAME=myapp
```
