# **Docker Volumes**

In Docker, volumes are a way to persist and share data between different containers and the host system itself. A volume is a directory or a file in the host filesystem that is mounted into a container.

## **Why Use Volumes**

<u>**Data Persistence**</u>: Volumes allow you to store data outside of the container's filesystem, which means that the data will persist even if the container is deleted or recreated.

<u>**Sharing Data Between Containers**</u>: Volumes can be shared between multiple containers, which makes it easy to build complex applications that require multiple services.

<u>**Sharing Data Between Host and Container**</u>: Volumes can also be used to share data between the host system and a container, which is useful for development and debugging.

# Bind Mounts - Older Version Of Volumes

Bind Mounts allow you to mount a specific directory or file from the host system directly into a container. 

Unlike Volumes, which are managed by Docker and stored within the Docker environment, Bind Mounts provide a **`direct link`** between the host filesystem and the container.
